#Implementation of linearization of Quadratic Shortest Path problem
##Algotrithms Design and Analysis
This repository is home to a project that develops a new, efficient algorithm to tackle the Quadratic Shortest Path Problem (QSPP) in acyclic digraphs. Inspired by the research paper “A linear time algorithm for linearizing quadratic and higher-order shortest path problems” [DOI: 10.1007/s10107-024-02086-z], our work translates the paper’s pseudocode into a clear and practical implementation.

We use the Graphine Dataset Graphine to test and benchmark our algorithm. [Link: https://zenodo.org/records/5320310#.YSxHgI77Q2w]
