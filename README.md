# Implementation of linearization of Quadratic Shortest Path problem

## Algorithms Design and Analysis

This repository is home to a project that develops a new, efficient algorithm to tackle the Quadratic Shortest Path Problem (QSPP) in acyclic digraphs. Inspired by the research paper “A linear time algorithm for linearizing quadratic and higher-order shortest path problems” [DOI: 10.1007/s10107-024-02086-z], our work translates the paper’s pseudocode into a clear and practical implementation.

We use the Graphine Dataset Graphine to test and benchmark our algorithm. [Link: https://zenodo.org/records/5320310#.YSxHgI77Q2w]

### Update (CP2)
We have identified that the algorithm is quite complex but we can slowly, but surely implement it. We have gone over a few of the lemmas in the article along with other aspects. We would be utilising the same dataset since it fulfils all of our requirements regarding this project (as far as we can tell).
