mosquitoes variably approach or avoid visible objects .
mosquitoes  ( night - flying )  may alter their flight paths when confronted with barriers ,  even when the barriers contain apertures large enough for their passage .

the steps needed for the intake of nectar and other plant sources .
feeding on nectar and other plant juices provides an immediate energy source and permits the formation of carbohydrate and lipid reserves .

three hours after larval - pupal ecdysis the epicuticle darkens .
formation of pharate cuticle starts during the later stages of dissolution of the pupal cuticle .
fifteen hours after larval - pupal ecdysis ,  apolysis starts .
the hormone from the neurosecretory cells of the brain activates the thoracic glands and causes them to secrete the moulting hormone .
during moulting ,  even when unaccompanied by any striking change of form ,  there is much reconstruction in the epidermis .
a condition in which growth or development is suspended and physiological activity is diminished .
during the first or second day after emergence ,  a mosquito undergoes behavioural maturation when ,  due to the action of hormones and other substances that act on the nervous system ,  it becomes competent in sexual behaviour .
male mosquitos become sexually responsive to flying conspecific females 12 - 36h after emergence ,  by which time their terminalia have inverted and their antennal fibrilae have become either permanenrly erect or capable of temporary erection .
observations of the coupling of force - mated or tethered females suggested that refractoriness is expressed through altered responses of the female terminalia to genital contact .
is a form of foraging ,  and it includes responses to the environment at three hierarchical levels: the habitat ,  the patch or biotope ,  and the resource item .

the reception of the physical stimuli is typically a three - stage process of coupling ,  transduction and encoding .
mechanical deformation of the dendritic membrane ,  producing receptor potentials .
a processual entity  [ span:processualentity ]  that is part of a process but that does not have bona fide beginnings and endings corresponding to real discontinuities .
is the conversion of receptor potentials to action potentials ,  which are beleived to arise in the cell membrane of the sensory neurone close to the junction between the cell body and axon .
conjugated proteins which are integral constituents of the membranes of photoreceptor organelles .
when the chromophore is in the 11 - cis configuration ,  the principal absorption peak of different visual pigments may appear anywhere in the spectrum between ultraviolet and yellow .
when the chromophore is in the all - trans configuration ,  and the visual pigment is in the meta - state , the absorption peak appears within a much narrower range ,  usually in the blue but in higher diptera in the orange .
the spectral sensitivity of a photoreceptor is determined by the absorption characteristics of its visual pigments .
a compound eye with no separation between the crystalline - cone layer and the retinula ,  each rhabdom receiving light only from its own corneal lens .
a compound eye in which a clear space is interposed between the dioptric apparatus and the retinula ,  and light from several corneal lenses falls on each rhabdom ,  producing a much brighter image .
a compound eye in certain diptera in which the rhabdomeres act as independent light guides .
for an eye to be capable of resolving fine detail ,  the angular separation between the receptors must be small .
the sensitivity  ( s )  of an eye is a measure of the size of the photon sample that it can capture from each direction .
for an eye for a grating  ( not for a point )  is twice the interommatidial angle .
is the highest spatial frequency that an eye can resolve .
the angular sensitivity of an ommatidium is determined by three parameters:  ( i )  optical blurring by the lens ;   ( ii )  the width of the rhabdom tip ;  nad  ( iii )  the waveguide properties of the rhabdom .
the half - width of the airy disc and the half - width of the rhabdom acceptance function combine to give the half - width of the ommatidial acceptance angle .

a pheromone is any chemical or set of chemicals produced by a living organism that transmits a message to other members of the same species .
the male and female behavioural patterns for sexual stimuli after the completion of their sexual maturation .
the ability of a male to inseminate a number of females depends upon the supply of both spermatozoa and accessory gland secretion .
once a female mosquito has undergone a consummated union she usually becomes refractory to further mating ,  at least until after completing a gonotropic cycle .
a strongly cyclic adult behaviour ,  and most species swarm for short periods around sunset and sunrise .
the lower level of station - keeping swarms reflects the pattern of the individual members .
a characteristic of sabethines is that the males patrol the area of vegetation in which conspecific females rest .
the mechanisms that prevent development of another series of follicles in gravid females .
in mosquitoes ,  egg production is a cyclic process .
the gates are points of potential or actual arrest at which follicular development will be halted ,  without detriment to the follicles ,  unless or until specific physiological conditions occur .
this description of ovarian stages is based on the development of primary ovarian follicles in ae aegypti and cx pipiens .
the ovarian cycle can be divided into sequential phases and stages using physiological and anatomical criteria .
in the earliest stage at which ovarian follicles are visibly distinct they are still closely attached to the germaria  ( christopher's stage g )  .
oocytes that have reached stage v and are ready for ovulation are often described as mature ,  yet their chromosomes are still in the metaphase of the first meiotic division .
the primary follicles may develop directly to christopher's stage iia or iib after emergence ,  or may develop to this stage only after the females have fed .
after follicles have separated from the germaria they grow slightly but may soon enter a state of arrest .
in most anautogenous species ,  follicles that pass the previtellogenic gate and start to deposit yolk in the oocytes either develop to maturity or are resorbed .
the follicle has partly separated from the germarium but the oocyte is not entirely surrounded by epithelium .
arrestants are substances that induces gravid females to remain in their presence through their own undirected kinetic responses ,  either by stopping their locomotion or changing their rate of turning .
the follicle has separated from the germarium and the oocyte is entirely surrounded by follicular epithelium .
the oocyte is distinguishable from the nurse cells by its smaller nucleus and prominent nucleolus .
some very small refractile lipid droplets are visible in the ooplasm .
the ooplasm contains fine lipid droplets ,  these cause the oocyte to appear slightly dark under transmitted light but white by reflected light .
the ooplasm is clouded with inclusions distinctly .
the follicle has increased in size considerably but without changing shape .
the follicle has grown further and has become slightly narrower ,  starting to assume the shape of a mature oocyte .
the follicle assumes the shape of the mature oocyte ,  or almost so ,  but has not reached full length .
the oocyte structures its full length .
attractants are substances that induces gravid females to make oriented movements towards its source .
the juvenile hormone in females of aedes aegypti increases markedly between 24 and 72h after emergence .
juvenile hormones is released after eclosion and stimulates the devlopment of host - seeking behaviour .
two developmental gates control the course of previtellogenic development .
when present ,  the deterrents  ( non - volatile substances )  inhibit oviposition  .
the weight of evidence suggests that gravid females respond negatively to chemical substances emanating from certain predators ,  but proof of this requires that these substances be isolated ,  identified and tested as repellents or deterents .
gravid females make oriented movements away from its source of any oviposition repellent .
electophysiological analysis of the reflex response showed that the labellar muscles are activated some 40ms after stimulation of the aboral sensilla with sucrose .
there is some evidence of mosquitoes responding to plant odours in the field .
female mosquitoes respond to host odour  ( co2 emission ,  water vapour ,  volatiles molecules )  .
host odour is here taken to comprise all volatile compounds ,  organic and inorganic ,  that emanate from a vertebrate host and that stimulate mosquito chemosensilla .
short ,  single walled ,  multiporous hair sensilla on the antennae of females aedes ,  culex and anopheles give electrical responses to volatile compounds suspected of being oviposition - site attractants .

mosquitoes that belong to this category contain three types of neurones that variously are excited by lactic acid vapour ,  inhibited by it or unresponsive to it .
behavioural responses of the female to chemical stimuli during the stages of pre - oviposition and oviposition .
in nature mosquitoes feed on nectar or blood .

shade can affect mosquito responses .
behavioural patterns expressed as a reaction to visual stimuli .
larvae and pupae that are at the water surface respond to certain stimuli with escape behaviour ,  often called an alarm response .
it is reported that mosquitoes  -  whether diurnal ,  crepuscular or nocturnal in activity  -  fed most often from lighter flowers .
when the tarsi of a walking mosquito touch a drop of sugar solution the mosquito stops moving or turns ,  and directs its proboscis towards the stimulus .
this term is used here in a broad sense ,  to include all the behavioural and physiological processes of a gravid female that lead up to and terminate in the deposition of eggs in an appropriate biotope .
the act of depositing eggs .
mosquitoes conform with other insects in maintaining lipid and glycogen stores in the fat body .
anoplines exhibit a variety of oviposition behaviours .
after a period of flying to and against the roof of the cage ,  the mosquitoes began to make descents to the floor .
a female that had touched the water surface changed her mode of flight abruptly ,  beginning to hover ,  with little displacement in space .
once arrived at the floor ,  the mosquitoes flew about at speeds 0 , 36m / s and at height that usually was 20 - 40mm .
the optical cues to which gravid females respond at oviposition sites may come from the water body itself or from its immediate surroundings .
for species in which the feeding and resting habitat is different from the oviposition habitat ,  the gravid females must respond to cues that characterize the 'landscape' before responding to stimuli that characterize specific oviposition sites .
chromaticity results from  ( i ) its hue ,  or dominant wavelengths ,  and  ( ii )  its chroma  ( saturation )  ,  the extend to which the predominant colour is unadulterated with white .
observing that when kept in complete darkness in a roomsized cage females of culex quinquefasciatus laid in the oviposition dishes provided  ( dishes which had chemical cues )  ,  whereas females of anopheles darlingi died without ovipositing .

this is an important form of predator avoidance .
the  \ "grooming \ " of other individuals has been considered a form of aggresive behaviour and an aspect of feeding .
while in depth ,  a larva remains motionless ,  often when near or underneath a leaf .
behavioural patterns of gravid females that result in arrival at potential oviposition sites and indicate the suitability of such sites are termed pre - oviposition behaviour .

during successive ovarian cycles the fat body passes through a parallel series of cyclesof ultrastructural generation and degeneration ,  during each of which the fat body cells or trophocytes exhibit three stages:  ( i )  a previtellogenic stage of activity .
in newly emerged females the cytoplasm of each trophocyte was rich in reserves ,  containing lipid droplets ,  glycogen bodies ,  and three types of membrane - bounded protein granule .
during this stage ,  the nucleolus became more multilobed ,  ribosome proliferation had been renewed ,  and the rough endoplasmic reticulum was undergoin reorganization .
termination of vitellogenin synthesis starts with a sharp decline in the concentration of vitellogenin in the fat body .

the reversible change in sensitivity of the lactic acid - sensitive neurones can account for the switching between host - finding and non - host - finding .
injection of picorgram quantities of 20 - hydroxyecdysone into ovariectomized females of aedes aegypti after blood - feeding caused a significant decrease in responsiveness to host cues when tested 72 h after blood - feeding ,  provided the females had been inseminated and were not deprived of sucrose .

the behaviours of male and virgin female mosquitoes relate principally to mating and feeding on plant juices .
in the laboratory ,  in most of the four nocturnal / crepuscular species investigated ,  insemination led to a reduction in the e and m flight - activity peaks shown by virgin femlaes and an increase in scotophase activity .
inseminated females that have taken a full blood meal are characteristically inactive during the first stages of vitellogenesis ,  although they may fly to obtain nectar .
