the process by which a particle or a set of particles crosses a barrier on its potential - energy surface without having the energy required to surmount this barrier .
a concerted process where the proton and the electron tunnel at the same time but independently of each other .
elementary chemical process undergone by an electronically excited molecular entity and yielding a primary photoproduct .
dissociation occurring by tunnelling from a 'bound' to an 'unbound' vibronic state .
