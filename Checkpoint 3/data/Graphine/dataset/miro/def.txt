an entity  [ bfo:entity ]  that exists in full at any time in which it exists at all ,  persists through time while maintaining its identity and has no temporal parts .
a continuant  [ snap:continuant ]  that is either dependent on one or other independent continuant  [ snap:independentcontinuant ]  bearers or inheres in or is borne by other entities .
a realizable entity  [ snap:realizableentity ]  that essentially causes a specific process or transformation in the object  [ snap:object ]  in which it inheres ,  under specific circumstances and in conjunction with the laws of nature .
a material entity  [ snap:materialentity ]  that is part of an object  [ snap:object ]  but is not demarcated by any physical discontinuities .
a realizable entity  [ snap:realizableentity ]  the manifestation of which is an essentially end - directed activity of a continuant  [ snap:continuant ]  entity in virtue of that continuant  [ snap:continuant ]  entity being a specific kind of entity in the kind or kinds of contexts that it is made for .
a continuant  [ snap:continuant ]  that is dependent on one or other independent continuant  [ snap:independentcontinuant ]  bearers .

a realizable entity  [ snap:realizableentity ]  the manifestation of which brings about some result or end that is not essential to a continuant  [ snap:continuant ]  in virtue of the kind of thing that it is but that can be served or participated in by that kind of continuant  [ snap:continuant ]  in some kinds of natural ,  social or institutional contexts .
an independent continuant  [ snap:independentcontinuant ]  consisting of a characteristic spatial shape in relation to some arrangement of other continuant  [ snap:continuant ]  entities and of the medium which is enclosed in whole or in part by this characteristic spatial shape .
