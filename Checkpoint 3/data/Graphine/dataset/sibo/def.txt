antenna -  the antenna in ants consists of an elongate basal segment ,  the scape ,  followed distally by 3 - 11 smaller segments which together constitute the funiculus  ( =flagellum )  ,  giving a total antennal segement count  ( =antennomere count )  of 4 to12 .
a groove ,  impresison ,  or excavation in the sie of the head ,  which runs above or below the eye ,  to accomidate at least the antennal scape ,  but often the entire antenna ,  when the latter folded back .

clypeus -  anterior sclerite of the dorsal head ,  bounded posteriorly by the fronto - clypeal suture ,  which is also very commonly called the posterior clypeal margin or border .
mandibles -  the appendages with which ants manipulate their environment .
pronotum -  see tergite
petiole -  the second abdominal segment immediately following the alitrunk ,  which is usually reduced and always isolated .
second visible tagma of an ants body following the head .
hypopygium -  the sternite of abdominal segment 7 ;  the terminal visible gastral sternite .
presclerite -  a distinctly differentiated anterior section of an abdominal sclerite ,  separated from the remainder of the sclerite by a ridge ,  constriction ,  or both .

path of patrolling: \ n1 .
foragers recognize returning patrollers during brief antennal contacts by detecting cues in task - specific cuticular hydrocarbons  ( green and gordon 2003 )  .
foragers travel from the nest in streams ,  or trails ,  and then fan out to individually search for seeds  ( gordon 1991 )  .
predation leads to quick return for patrollers to nest .
emerge from nest at sunrise .
