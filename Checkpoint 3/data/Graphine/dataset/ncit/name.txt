patient provider orientation scale
doctor should decide what gets talked about during visit
health care is less personal but pays for medical advances
self - examination
most important part of standard medical visit is physical exam
often best for patients to not have full explanation of medical condition
patient should rely on doctor's knowledge and not find out about their conditions
doctors asking lots of questions about patient's background is prying into personal matters
if doctors are good at diagnosis and treatment then their relations with patients not important
many patients continue asking questions when not learning anything new
patients should be treated as equal partners with doctor
patients generally want reassurance rather than information about health
if doctor's primary tools are being open and warm ,  doctor will not have success
disagreement is sign that doctor does not have patient's respect and trust
mammoplasty
treatment plan cannot succeed if in conflict with patient's lifestyle or values
most patients want to get in and out of doctor's office as quickly as possible
patient must always be aware that doctor is in charge
not important to know patient's culture and background to treat their illness
humor is major ingredient in doctor's treatment of patient
when patients look up medical information this confuses more than helps
moderately disagree
